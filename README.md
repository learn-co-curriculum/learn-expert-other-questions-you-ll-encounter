# Using the Reference Guide

This track covers the logistics of being a Technical Coach, teaching tips on answering questions, and common technical problems you'll encounter. 

But there are a lot more scenarios and questions you'll see as a Technical Coach. The [Reference Guide](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support) covers a lot of them and we'll be continuously refining, editing, and adding more info to it. Here are some things that it covers so far. Also make sure to check out the [Help Docs](http://help.learn.co)!

- [Questions about Blogging](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/blogging.md)
- [Environment Setup Issues](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/environment-setup.md)
- [Learn IDE Issues](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/learn-ide.md)
- [Common Lab Errors](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/common-lab-errors.md)  (we'll refine this further)
